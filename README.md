# URLs_Shortner_Using_TinyURL_API
Via Api we will generate short urls
Hi All!!!
Here i have uploaded version 1 of short urls generation using tinyUrl api. This is achieved by calling external api.
First of all before anything, if you want to use this, you must create an account in TinyUrl website and generate a bearer token.
This bearer tocken is used to authenticate the request and for processing.
You only need to replace "your bearer token" line alone with ur bearer token that you will generate from their website.
if you get any import issues in any of the IDE you are using, use the jars i have added under UseableJars.zip as external libraries and that should resolve your issues.
And this is 1st version of the api only, please wait for 2nd version also where i will do this whole process from java awt.
Thanks for checking out the page and Happy Coding!!!!
